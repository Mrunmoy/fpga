# This project demostrates PMOD GPIO Interfacing
- with Microblaze soft core on Basys3 board
- using the [4-LED PMOD module from Digilent](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodled/start)
- Vivado 2018.3

### Instructions:-
_Make sure that Basys3 board is setup for JTAG mode._
1. Download the project and open in Vivado.
2. Click File > Launch SDK
3. Follow rest of the steps from step 8 [here](https://reference.digilentinc.com/vivado/getting-started-with-ipi/start) to program fpga and run.

The source code for led sequence is under the c project:
